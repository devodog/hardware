Next version needs a 1k resistor in parallell with 1uF capacitor.
As the output from the hit detector is to be connected to a GPIO input on a 3.3V mcu as a external interrutp pin.
The hit detektor outputs 5V and therefor needs some kind of level conversion.

One way to implementing this level conversion would be to connect a 1k resistor to the output of the comparator
and let this signal be wired to the actual gpio-port on the mcu, through the signal-board.

To ensure that the signal received on the mcu gpio-port is within the max input voltage range, 
the catode of a 3.0V zerner diode ia connected to the "output" of the 1k resistor and the anode is connected to ground.

For now it is decided that the levelconversion is done on the signal board.
